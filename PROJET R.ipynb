The name dates from the early 20th century and is derived from the fact that the neighbourhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.                                                                                          </td><td>...

From the beginning of the 1900s, this was the ground zero of social housing in the Netherlands. It is still a very diverse neighborhood, but it has recently been renovated and is now a place where lots of young couples and families reside. Check out the lovey Zaanhof (courtyard) just around the corner of our house, which has a playing ground, and enjoy an afternoon with a book at the fountain. And when it's hot, check out the Bredius open air swimming pool - a 5 minute walk.  There are some great restaurants at walking distance, like Morris &amp; Bella, Freud, Bar Mick and Pinsa's Pizzeria (all on Spaarndammerstraat). Jump on your bicycle and enjoy a fantastic view at the IJ river when dining at Pont 13 (boat) or on the upper floar of REM eiland. The Westerpark is very nearby, good for running, picknicks, festivals. And if you want even more activity, just head to the center, it's close!                        </span>                                          </td><td>...

The name dates from the early 20th century and is derived from the fact that the neighbourhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55\\%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.                                               & ...

From the beginning of the 1900s, this was the ground zero of social housing in the Netherlands. It is still a very diverse neighborhood, but it has recently been renovated and is now a place where lots of young couples and families reside. Check out the lovey Zaanhof (courtyard) just around the corner of our house, which has a playing ground, and enjoy an afternoon with a book at the fountain. And when it's hot, check out the Bredius open air swimming pool - a 5 minute walk.  There are some great restaurants at walking distance, like Morris \\& Bella, Freud, Bar Mick and Pinsa's Pizzeria (all on Spaarndammerstraat). Jump on your bicycle and enjoy a fantastic view at the IJ river when dining at Pont 13 (boat) or on the upper floar of REM eiland. The Westerpark is very nearby, good for running, picknicks, festivals. And if you want even more activity, just head to the center, it's close!                                                                     & ...

The name dates from the early 20th century and is derived from the fact that the neighbourhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.                                               | ...

From the beginning of the 1900s, this was the ground zero of social housing in the Netherlands. It is still a very diverse neighborhood, but it has recently been renovated and is now a place where lots of young couples and families reside. Check out the lovey Zaanhof (courtyard) just around the corner of our house, which has a playing ground, and enjoy an afternoon with a book at the fountain. And when it's hot, check out the Bredius open air swimming pool - a 5 minute walk.  There are some great restaurants at walking distance, like Morris & Bella, Freud, Bar Mick and Pinsa's Pizzeria (all on Spaarndammerstraat). Jump on your bicycle and enjoy a fantastic view at the IJ river when dining at Pont 13 (boat) or on the upper floar of REM eiland. The Westerpark is very nearby, good for running, picknicks, festivals. And if you want even more activity, just head to the center, it's close!                                                                       | ...

       "1 Indische Buurt (\"Indies Neighborhood\") is a neighbourhood in the eastern portion of the city of Amsterdam, in the Dutch province of Noord-Holland. The name dates from the early 20th century and is derived from the fact that the neighbourhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.\n",

It is still a very diverse neighborhood, but it has recently been renovated and is now a place where lots of young couples and families reside. Check out the lovey Zaanhof (courtyard) just around the corner of our house, which has a playing ground, and enjoy an afternoon with a book at the fountain. And when it's hot, check out the Bredius open air swimming pool - a 5 minute walk.  There are some great restaurants at walking distance, like Morris & Bella, Freud, Bar Mick and Pinsa's Pizzeria (all on Spaarndammerstraat). Jump on your bicycle and enjoy a fantastic view at the IJ river when dining at Pont 13 (boat) or on the upper floar of REM eiland. The Westerpark is very nearby, good for running, picknicks, festivals. And if you want even more activity, just head to the center, it's close!                        \n",

The place is located in the quiet neighbourhood so we are away from all the noises, but it is also very close to all the public transportations so getting into the city is fairly easy and fast.

He made everything so easy for us! The room was super clean and well equipped, the beds were very comfortable! Daniel also gave us good advices,  tips and tools (maps, compass, umbrella..) for getting around the city. The place is located in the quiet neighbourhood so we are away from all the noises, but it is also very close to all the public transportations so getting into the city is fairly easy and fast. I highly recommend Daniele's place!\n",

He made everything so easy for us! The room was super clean and well equipped, the beds were very comfortable! Daniel also gave us good advices,  tips and tools (maps, compass, umbrella..) for getting around the city. The place is located in the quiet neighbourhood so we are away from all the noises, but it is also very close to all the public transportations so getting into the city is fairly easy and fast. I highly recommend Daniele's place!\n",

       "1 Daniel is really cool. The place was nice and clean. Very quiet neighborhood. He had maps and a lonely planet guide book in the room for you to use. I didnt have any trouble finding the place from Central Station. I would defintely come back! Thanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "2 Daniel is the most amazing host! His place is extremely clean, and he provides everything you could possibly want (comfy bed, guidebooks & maps, mini-fridge, towels, even toiletries). He is extremely friendly and helpful, and will go out of his way to help you if needed, or just let you come and go as you please. Highly recommended!                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "3 We had such a great time in Amsterdam. Daniel is an excellent host! Very friendly and everytime helpful. The room was cozy, comfortable, and VERY clean. Maps, towels, mini-fridge, coffee (very tasty) and tea supplies were provided. Bathroom with all the bathroom requires. Good location - next to the tram stop and it took just around 10-15 minutes to get to the city center.\\nTotally recommendable!                                                                             \n",
       "4 Very professional operation. Room is very clean and comfortable. Location is close to tram or bus which take you to most of attractions. A great and helpful host who want to ensure you enjoy your stay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "5 Daniel is highly recommended.  He provided all necessities (and actually went way beyond what's expected of a great host). His place is very clean.  It is also convenient to buses and trams which will take you around the city in minutes.  You will truly feel like a local here.                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "6 Daniel was a great host! He made everything so easy for us! The room was super clean and well equipped, the beds were very comfortable! Daniel also gave us good advices,  tips and tools (maps, compass, umbrella..) for getting around the city. The place is located in the quiet neighbourhood so we are away from all the noises, but it is also very close to all the public transportations so getting into the city is fairly easy and fast. I highly recommend Daniele's place!\\n\\n"
